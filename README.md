Factory design pattern
Creational type of design pattern.
Main feature of factory design pattern is loose coupling. When new keyword is used to create object it makes application tightly coupled . 
To overcome this problem we use factory design which creates object by providing our input.

Template design pattern
Behavioural type of design pattern.
Used for code reusability.
It states that if we have common method for multiple services then add them into a abstract class to avoid code duplicacy.
